**NOTICE:**

Dear Co-Authors:

This document incorporates all the latest data updates/fixes into the tables and into the parts of the text where values from those tables are referenced. This has two goals:

1. Being able to see the tables all in one place, in the same order they are referenced in the text.
2. To have one place from which to copy-paste the version of the text that has the up-to-date numbers.

However, please note this is **not** the official draft of the HMRFS paper. Currently, not all sections are included here. Moreover, this document is automatically generated by scripts and will be updated on a regular basis so any edits you make to it will be lost. Please continue treating the document [MOST_CURRENT_VERSION.docx](https://cmh.box.com/s/a30oj1vg0p3zv3bcqoin0nfrowbejvyb) as the working draft.

While I have your attention-- if the long ugly variable names in the tables are giving you a headache, now you can help solve this problem. Please go to the file [var_level_names.xls.gsheet](https://cmh.box.com/s/ignwc8jo05nd7dmr358c4xseftrom7rg), and click **Open** in the upper right. It is a spreadsheet and you can write into the **description** column what you think we should standardize on as the published name/s of the variable/s you are thinking about to the left of that column.

-- Sincerely, Alex F. Bokov
