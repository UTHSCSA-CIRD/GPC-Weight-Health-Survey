**NOTICE:**

Dear Co-Authors:

This document incorporates all the latest data updates/fixes into the tables and into the parts of the text where values from those tables are referenced. This has two goals:

1. Being able to see the tables all in one place, in the same order they are referenced in the text.
2. To have one place from which to copy-paste the version of the text that has the up-to-date numbers.

However, please note this is **not** the official draft of the HMRFS paper. Currently, not all sections are included here. Moreover, this document is automatically generated by scripts and will be updated on a regular basis so any edits you make to it will be lost. Please continue treating the document [Updated GPC Outcomes paper 12 27 17.docx](https://cmh.box.com/s/y1yyzvr4jnzf2dy5s1l1tp797z70yn6i) as the working draft.

-- Sincerely, Alex F. Bokov
