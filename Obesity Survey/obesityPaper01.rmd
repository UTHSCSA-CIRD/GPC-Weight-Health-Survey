# Abstract

**Objective:** The aim of this paper is to report onthe initial obesity project from the Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC), a Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN) that is part of the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) National Patient Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORNet). 

**Materials and Methods:** The electronic health records of 10academic medical centers in 8 Midwestern states were coordinated in order to allow for a prospective multi-site obesity focused research project to be conducted. A survey was designed to assess participant willingness for themselves, and their children (if appropriate) to participate in research, as well as the use of their health record data for research.The survey was composed of 7 questions regarding interest in medical research, as well as basic demographic and health related information. Each site had a goal of 1,000 initial positive survey responses and 100 completed surveys.

**Results:** A cohort of 54,274 patients was created across the participating sites.  Data indicate that completers were 57% female, 84% Caucasian, 39.6% Public/Self-insured, with mean age of 27.5 (18.35) years and a mean BMI of 25.73 (7.95). In general, a third of respondents had participated in research previously and were positive about being contacted for additional research both for themselves and for their children. Responses did vary by site.

## Contacting Participants

Potential participants were contacted through one of three means: the United States Postal Service (USPS), email (EMAIL), or through the patient portal feature of the electronic medical record systems (PORTAL). The method of contact was selected by each HMRFS site PI based on logistics and local policy requirements. For a detailed list of site and contact method see Table 3. Whether adult patients, pediatric patients, or both were contact for the current study also varied by site (Table 3).

Prior to analysis the `r nrow(obd)` records were randomly assigned to a development (N=`r .n01['train']`), 
validation (N=`r .n01['val']`), and test subsets 
(N=`r .n01['test']`) in order to avoid overfitting and bias due to within-sample testing. All analysis
decisions were made based on the developmental subset. The first
goal was to identify candidate predictors for survey participation from among the variables available for all 
members of the cohort (i.e. those listed in Table 4). 

Accordingly, for each candidate predictor, a separate logistic regression model was fit to the developmental subset with responder
status as the outcome. Discrete variables with multiple levels were broken up into an equal number of indicator variables. This allowed us to
choose not only predictor variables to consider but also in some 
cases how condense their levels. Table 8 shows the results of these `r length(tb$t07.univar) - 2` tests.

## HMRFS Survey
`r table(obd$s2resp)['Yes']` individuals completed the HMRFS survey across all sites. Of these respondents, most self-reported as female (`r pct(tb$d03.survey$CatTable$Overall$sex$percent['Female']/100)`),  Caucasian  (`r pct(tb$d03.survey$CatTable$Overall$White$percent['White']/100)`), 
and  having  private  insurance  (`r pct(tb$d03.survey$CatTable$Overall$insurance$percent['Private']/100)`). The modal range of self-reported household  income  was approximately $50,000/year and average age was 27.50 years with a baseline mean BMI of 25.73 (7.95). These data  indicate  the  sample  that  responded  to  the  HMRFS  survey  was  similar  to  the  overall  cohort  of  eligible patients. Responses indicatethat across all sites (Table 8), `r pct(tb$d03.survey$CatTable$Overall$research$percent['Yes']/100)` of respondents had participated previously in medical   research.   Respondents   were   generally   open   to   investigators   contacting   them   about possible participationin studies (42.7% yes; 38.9% maybe). Key factors in making the decision to participate in medical research  included:topic  of  research  (`r pct(tb$d03A.pr_me['PR_Me_DependsAbout'])`),  time  (`r pct(tb$d03A.pr_me['PR_Me_Time'])`),  doctor  recommendation  (`r pct(tb$d03A.pr_me['PR_Me_Doctor_Op'])`),  reimbursement  (`r pct(tb$d03A.pr_me['PR_Me_Compensation'])`), and child  involvement  (`r pct(tb$d03A.pr_me['PR_Me_Involve_Child'])`). Of  respondents who  had  children  (64.1%), they  were  also  generally  positive  about possibly allowing their child to take part in medical research (29.6% yes; 39.1% maybe). When answering on behalf of their children instead of themselves the followng  Most participants were in favor of their medical information being used for research (35.3% fantastic idea, 48.6% good idea) and even more so if the data being used for medical research is de-identified (32.4% fantastic idea, 49.5% good idea).
